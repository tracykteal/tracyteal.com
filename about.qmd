Hello! I am an open source champion, data scientist, and educator at [Posit Software, PBC](https://posit.co/) where I am the Open Source Program Director. 

I love working with open source communities, developing curriculum, and teaching people how to work with data and code. As director of 
Data Carpentry, and then The Carpentries, I worked to build inclusive community teaching data and coding skills to researchers, bringing people to data. As director of Dryad, an open data repository, I 

I serve on the boards of [CarbonPlan], [pyOpenSci] and the [R Consortium], all great projects! 

### Resources

I always recommend [Data Carpentry] and [Software Carpentry] lessons to people looking to learn how to get started working with data and developing software.

There's a few other things I've found helpful along the way, so I've put together information on [how to give a lightning talk], [an introduction to workshop introductions], and an [open source developer relations handbook].

I'm working on curriculum on [how to manage an open source project] and have a few talks on the topic, including from [PyData Seattle 2023]. 

I've written or contributed to talks and articles on data science training, data science and collaboration practices, and career pathways, and [have a selected list of these materials].

I'm also super excited about Quarto, and how easy Quarto makes it to create and publish reproducible and accessible articles, websites, and presentations. I have talks on [a few of my favorite things about Quarto presentations] and [publishing Jupyter notebooks with Quarto].
