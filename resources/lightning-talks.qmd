I love lightning talks! They're one of the best ways to share about your project and get people interested quickly. They're also tough talks to give because you have to really plan out what you're going to talk about, since you don't have much time.

These are notes I put together for some SciPy and rstudio::conf() meetings, where I was moderating lightning talks sessions.
