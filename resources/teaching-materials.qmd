Some teaching materials I know and love on a few different topics. 

### Working with data and code

I highly recommend all of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teaching materials for getting started to work with data and code in research. These are a few of my favorites:

- [Data Carpentry Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/)
- [Data Carpentry Data Cleaning with OpenRefine](https://datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/)
- [Data Carpentry Data Analysis and Visualization with R](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/)
- [Carpentries Incubator R and the tidyverse for working with data](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/r-tidyverse-4-datasets/)



### Microbial metagenomics

If you're interested in learning about microbial metagenomics, these are some of our materials from [STAMPS](https://www.mbl.edu/education/advanced-research-training-courses/course-offerings/strategies-and-techniques-analyzing-microbial-population-structures) and EDAMAME.

- [MBL Strategies and Techniques for the Analyizing Microbial Population Structures (STAMPS) 2022](https://github.com/mblstamps/stamps2022/wiki)
- [Explorations in Data Analysis for Metagenomic Advances in Microbial Ecology (EDAMAME)](https://github.com/edamame-course)
