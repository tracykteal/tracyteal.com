An important part of the work in open source is in developer relations. While each role has its differences there are similarities in the things each dev rel team or individual need to think about. This Open Source Developer Relations Team Handbook template is meant to capture some of those ideas and provide a framework for teams to fill in for their own work and communities.

It\'s meant to be a set of guidelines and
information that a team can use on how they work, that they can use as
their own reference and to share with other stakeholders.

These handbooks are meant to be living documents, meant to evolve and
change. Documentation is only useful if it\'s referenced and used, so
you want to continue to adapt structure and content in a way that works
for it to be most helpful to you.

These are some ideas and resources on how open source developer
relations can work, and templates and guidelines that could be useful to
people in similar roles.
