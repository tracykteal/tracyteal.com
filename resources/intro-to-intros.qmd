Think back to courses or workshops you really liked or didn't like. 

How did those courses start on the first day? Were you confident in the instructors ability to teach the course? Did you feel like the instructor was enthusiastic about the course and invested in the students outcomes? Was it clear what you were going to be learning? Were you excited to get the chance to be learning about those things? Or did you leave that first day thinking the instructor was uninterested, that you weren't the students they wanted to be teaching or you had no idea what the course was supposed to be about?

I imagine that your impression on that first day matched that of the rest of the workshop or the course. We don't usually think explicitly about introductions, but they set the tone for the workshop and the path for learner outcomes. So, what we obviously need is an introduction to introductions!
