    "text": "Photo by charlesdeluvio on Unsplash\nThink back to courses or workshops you really liked or didn’t like.\nHow did those courses start on the first day? Were you confident in the instructors ability to teach the course? Did you feel like the instructor was enthusiastic about the course and invested in the students outcomes? Was it clear what you were going to be learning? Were you excited to get the chance to be learning about those things? Or did you leave that first day thinking the instructor was uninterested, that you weren’t the students they wanted to be teaching or you had no idea what the course was supposed to be about?\nI imagine that your impression on that first day matched that of the rest of the workshop or the course. We don’t usually think explicitly about introductions, but they set the tone for the workshop and the path for learner outcomes. So, what we obviously need is an introduction to introductions!\nAn introduction to introductions"

    "text": "Photo by charlesdeluvio on Unsplash\nAn important part of the work in open source is in developer relations. While each role has its differences there are similarities in the things each dev rel team or individual need to think about. This Open Source Developer Relations Team Handbook template is meant to capture some of those ideas and provide a framework for teams to fill in for their own work and communities.\nIt's meant to be a set of guidelines and information that a team can use on how they work, that they can use as their own reference and to share with other stakeholders.\nThese handbooks are meant to be living documents, meant to evolve and change. Documentation is only useful if it's referenced and used, so you want to continue to adapt structure and content in a way that works for it to be most helpful to you.\nThese are some ideas and resources on how open source developer relations can work, and templates and guidelines that could be useful to people in similar roles.\n\nOpen Source Developer Relations Team Handbook\n\nGitHub repository\nPublished OS Dev Rel Team Handbook template"
