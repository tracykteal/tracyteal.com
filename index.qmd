Hello! I'm Tracy Teal. I love working with open source communities, developing structures and systems that support people in doing their work, thinking about sustainable maintenance, and creating resources that help people learn about data science and open source. 

Most recently I was the Open Source Program Director at [Posit](https://posit.co/) (formerly named RStudio). Prior to that I worked in academia (doing research, open source software development, and teaching), finishing my PhD in microbiology and bioinformatics from Caltech, before moving into data science and non-profit work as Executive Director of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), and then Executive Director of [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/). I see inclusive leadership as fundamental to reaching the potential of open source and data science where all people can participate, and try to bring this perspective to my work and what I continue to learn.

I serve on the boards of [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/) and [CarbonPlan](https://carbonplan.org/), and various other advisory committees. All great projects!


There's a few things I've found helpful along the way, so I've put together information on [how to give a lightning talk](https://github.com/tracykteal/lightning-talks), [an introduction to workshop introductions](https://github.com/tracykteal/instructors-introduction), and ideas for an [open source developer relations handbook](https://github.com/tracykteal/devrel-handbook).

I'm working on curriculum on [how to manage an open source project](https://tracykteal.github.io/managing-os-project-workshop/) and have a few talks on the topic, including from [PyData Seattle 2023 (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiXhTA6zkjA). 

I've written or contributed to talks and articles on data science training, data science and collaboration practices, and career pathways, and [have a selected list of these materials](/resources.html).

I'm also super excited about Quarto, and how easy Quarto makes it to create and publish reproducible and accessible articles, websites, and presentations. I have talks on [a few of my favorite things about Quarto presentations (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttLnLdU1-CQ) and [publishing Jupyter notebooks with Quarto (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nkUcwBgoME).
